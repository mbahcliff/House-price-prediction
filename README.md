# Real Estate Price Prediction

## Problem Statement

Consider a real estate company that has a dataset containing the prices of different houses  of unit area. The company intends to use this data to creat a system that helps predict the price of housing based on the independent variables which includes: housing age, distance to the nearest MRT station, number of convenience stores, latitude and longitude

## Essentially, the company wants —

•	To identify the variables affecting house prices per unit area, 
•	To create a linear model that quantitatively relates house prices with variables such as house age, distance to the nearest MRT station etc
•	To know the accuracy of the model, i.e. how well these variables can predict house prices.

## Business Goal

I am required to model the price of houses of a unit area with the available independent variables. It will be used by the management to understand how exactly the prices vary with the independent variables. They can accordingly manipulate the design of the houses, the business strategy etc. to meet certain price levels. Further, the model will be a good way for management to understand the pricing dynamics of a new market.

## Dataset

The dataset includes  414 rows and 8 columns. It has independent features; house age, distance to the nearest MRT station, numbetr of convenience stores, latitude and longitude. All of these features play a very important roll in our prediction of of house price per unit area (y).
