# Real Estate Price Prediction

## Introduction

Consider a real estate company that wants to predict the prices of different houses  of unit area using some indepedent features. The company intends to use this data to creat a system that helps predict the price of housing based on the independent variables which includes: housing age, distance to the nearest MRT station, number of convenience stores, latitude and longitude
A simple predictive machine learning algorithm such as linear regression can be used to build the model.

## Essentially, the company wants —

•	To identify the variables affecting house prices per unit area, 
•	To create a linear model that quantitatively relates house prices with variables such as house age, distance to the nearest MRT station etc
•	To know the accuracy of the model, i.e. how well these variables can predict house prices.

## Business Goal

I am required to build a predictive system using machine learning algorithm that predicts the house price of unit area with the available features. It will be used to understand how exactly the prices vary with the independent variables. The design of the house can be adjusted, the business strategy etc. to meet certain price levels. Further, the model will be a good way for management to understand the pricing dynamics of a new market.

## Dataset

The dataset includes  414 rows and 8 columns. It has independent features; house age, distance to the nearest MRT station, numbetr of convenience stores, latitude and longitude. All of these features play a very important roll in our prediction of of house price per unit area (y).
